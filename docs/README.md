## Calculator Modules

### Unified Loan Calculator
The unified loan calculator handles multiple loan types:
- Personal Loans
- Home Loans
- Car Loans
- Business Loans
- Education Loans
- Balloon Loans

Each loan type has specific:
- Validation rules
- Interest rate ranges
- Tenure limits
- Additional fields

### Unified Investment Calculator
Handles various investment types:
- SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)
- Lumpsum Investments
- Recurring Deposits
- Fixed Deposits

Features:
- Tax implications

- PPF calculations

## Core Features

### Form Validation
- Schema-based validation using Zod
- Real-time validation
- Type-specific validation rules
- Error handling and display

### Calculations
All financial calculations follow standard financial mathematics:
```typescript
// Example: SIP calculation
const futureValue = monthlyInvestment * 
  ((Math.pow(1 + r, n) - 1) / r) * (1 + r);
where:
r = annualRate / 12 / 100
n = years * 12
```

### Data Persistence
- Uses IndexedDB for calculation history
- Supports offline functionality
- Data encryption for sensitive information

### Security Measures
1. Input Validation
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Validate numerical ranges
   - Prevent XSS attacks

2. Data Protection
   - No sensitive data storage
   - Client-side encryption where needed
   - Secure calculation methods

3. Error Handling
   - Graceful error recovery
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Logging and monitoring

## State Management
- React's useState and useContext for local state
- Custom hooks for complex state logic
- Memoization for performance optimization

## Performance Optimization
1. Code Splitting
   - Dynamic imports for calculator modules
   - Lazy loading for non-critical components

2. Caching Strategy
   - Results caching
   - Calculation memoization
   - Static page generation where possible

3. Bundle Optimization
   - Tree shaking
   - Code minification
   - Image optimization

## Internationalization
The application supports multiple languages and number formats:
- Currency formatting
- Number localization
- Date formatting
- RTL support

## SEO Optimization
- Static metadata
- Dynamic meta tags
- Structured data
- Semantic HTML

## Accessibility
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast compliance

## Testing
1. Unit Tests
   - Calculator logic
   - Validation rules
   - Utility functions

2. Integration Tests
   - Form submissions
   - Calculator workflows
   - State management

3. E2E Tests
   - User journeys
   - Cross-browser testing

## Development Guide
